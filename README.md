# Awards API

Welcome to the Awards API! This API allows you to query awards data.

## Features

- Fetch all awards
- Fetch awards by year, IMDB ID, TMDB ID, title, winner status, acting category, category, and person
- Detailed API documentation available at `/api-docs`

## Getting Started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server

## API Documentation

Detailed API documentation is available at the `/api-docs` endpoint when the server is running. The documentation includes information about the available endpoints, how to use them, and the data format.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Notes for my future self

- This is deployed using Glitch and is available at (https://gleaming-held-wandflower.glitch.me).
- To update the awards data we should just need to update AcademyAwards.json with an updated version.
- Anytime you make changes to this content you'll need to reimport it to Glitch by clicking "Tools > Import and Export" at the bottom of the Glitch project page.
